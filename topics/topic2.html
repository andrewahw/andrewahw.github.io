        <div id = "title"> <h1>Why use Fourier Transforms?</h1> </div>
        <p>From the previous slide, we learnt that Fourier Transforms turn the time domain of a function into a frequency domain.
          Using this understanding, here are some examples of how it can be used.</p>

          <div class = "collapsibleContent">
            <p>For audio, we can imagine our <b>time domain representing the amplitude</b> ("level") of the sound over time.
              So by transforming this time domain into a frequency domain, we can manipulate it in various ways:
            </p>

            <p><i>This equaliser shows frequencies from ~100Hz to 2kHz being amplified above others.</i></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Equalisers:</b> An equaliser allows for certain frequencies to be amplified or suppressed by directly editing the frequency domain of the sound.</li>
              <li><b>Background Noise Removal:</b> By removing specific frequencies, background noises such as hissing or white noise.</li>
              <li><b>Pitch Detection/Shifting:</b> The pitch of a sound can be easily identified from its frequency domain.
                 This can also be used to change the pitch by shifting the entire frequency domain</li>
            </ul>

          <div class = "collapsibleContent">
            <p>With images, we can separate the image into <b>different channels</b> (e.g. colour channels), then apply a Fourier transform to each channel.
              Manipulating these can give some interesting uses:
            </p>

            <p><i>Although not an image, removing the lower frequencies of a square wave is the same principle as edge detection in images.
               Here, the blue is the "edges" while the red is the entire square wave.
            </i></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Image Editing:</b> Changing the frequency domain of an image can change the contrast, or remove detail.</li>
              <li><b>Edge detection:</b> Applying a high-pass filter (removing low frequencies) can highlight the edges in an image</li>
              <li><b>Compression:</b> By encoding an image with its frequency domain, images can be compressed by removing the high frequencies.
              JPEG compression is the prime example of this, although it uses the Discrete Cosine Transform instead.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Given these real world applications, how does the simulation on the right relate to all of this?
           This simulation is designed to show how <b>image compression can use Fourier (or other) Transforms</b>, and also some of the artefacts you get from compression.
        </p>
        <p>To understand how this works, let's consider a sample 4x4 grid, with a random number from 1-10 in each cell.
          First, we can <b>turn this into an array of these same values</b> by reading it like so:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/samples 4x4.png" style="width:80%; height:30%; border-radius:10px;border:4px solid #1f509a1f;margin: auto; display: block;">
        <p>Then, by using a Fourier Transform, we can extract the freqency domain from these values.
          This gives us <b>16 frequencies that can perfectly recreate our samples.</b>
        </p>
        <p>However, we don't need a <i>perfect</i> reprentation (especially for larger chunks), so what we do is <b>discard some of the higher frequencies.</b>
          When done right, this means <b>we store less data overall</b>, compressing our file.
        </p>

        <p>Now, feel free to play around with this simulation to see it working with actual images!</p>
