        <div id = "title"> <h1>What is Fourier Analysis?</h1> </div>
        <p><i>"Fourier analysis is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions."</i><br> - Wikipedia<p>
        <p>In easier terms, Fourier analysis covers how signals can be decomposed into <b>a sum of individual sine and/or cosine waves.</b>
           These signals can represent anything from sound, the distribution of temperature of an object, or even the position of an object over time.</p>

        <p><i>The image above shows how a signal (at the top) can be broken down into a sum of 3 different sines and cosine waves.</i></p>
        <p>Formally, this process of decomposition is called a <b>Fourier Transform</b>, which "transforms" the <b>time domain</b> of a function into a <b>frequency domain</b>. The inverse of this is either called <b>Fourier Synthesis</b> or (intuitively) the <b>Inverse Fourier Transform.</b></p>

          <summary class = "collapsibleTitle">What are time/frequency domains?</summary> <!--Collapsible-->
          <div class = "collapsibleContent">
            <p>For any function, a domain refers to <b>what inputs the function can take.</b>
               For example, a function that adds up all the integers from 0 up to a given number will have the domain of the positive integers.</p>
            <p>In our case of a time and frequency domain, <b>we can imagine our signal as a function</b> that returns the height of a point that follows the signal at any given time.
               This is the <b>time domain of our function</b>, as we input the time and it outputs the height the point based on our signal.</p> 
            <p>When we perform a Fourier transform, we create a new function based on this signal that outputs the amplitude of a component wave given the frequency of that component wave.
               We call this the <b>frequency domain of our original function</b>, as we are now inputting frequencies instead of our original time domain.</p>
          </div>
        </details> 
        <p>Practically, there are many different methods of performing a Fourier transform, of which we'll cover the <b>Discrete Fourier Transform.</b>
           This allows individual samples to be turned into waves, which allows it to be used more practically.</p>
          <summary class = "collabsibleTitle">What about Fourier series?</summary> <!--Another Collapsible-->
          <div class = "collapsibleContent">
            <p>Another area under Fourier Analysis is Fourier series, which also turns our time domain function into a frequency domain.
              So how are they different?</p>

        <p>To see the versatility of Fourier Analysis, you can play around with the different component waves in the simulation on the right.</p>
