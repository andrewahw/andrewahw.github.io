        <p>Now we know more about Fourier Transforms, let's look at an actual example you can use.</p>
        <p>The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) allows the <b>transformation of an array of individual samples</b> to another array of frequencies.
          To understand it, let's see the mathematical formulation.
        </p>
        <details> <!--could also introduce complex numbers through polar coordinates, but this seems ok-->

          <div class = "collapsibleContent">
            <p>To fully understand this formulation, we first must understand complex numbers</p>
            <!--Image of an argan diagram with a single point-->
            <p>Complex numbers can be imagined as a <b>point on 2D space</b> - with an "x" and "y" component.
              We express this in the form <i>a + bi</i>, where the "a" represents our x component, and the "b" our y component.
            </p>
            <p>Another way of expressing complex numbers is by <b>it's relation to the origin, 0</b>.
               Generally we do this in the form <i>r * e^iθ</i>, where "r" is the distance from the origin (it's modulus)
               and "θ" is the angle between the point and the origin in radians (it's argument).
            </p>
            <p>(Proving this is quite cool, but is also beyond the scope of this website!)</p>
            <p>Lastly, we can multiply complex numbers by <b>adding their arguments and multiplying their moduli.</b></p>
          </div>

        <p>But what does this mean practically? To understand it, let's break it down.</p>
        <p>This formula <b>outputs the amplitude and phase</b> (expressed as X(k)) of a sinusoid given a frequency, k.
          To calculate it, we take each sample x(n), multiply it by it's corresponding ω^n, and add them all together.
          This gives us a complex number, where <b>the modulus corresponds to its amplitude, and the argument corresponds to its phase.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Going a bit deeper, let's take a closer look at ω. Immediately we can see that it is in the form <i>r * e^iθ</i>.
          This tells us that it has <b>a modulus of 1, and an argument of -2πk/N.</b>
          To see what this means, let's consider all ω for all integers values of k with an N of 5.
        </p>

        <p>Intuitively, it looks like it forms a pentagon!
          Therefore, by raising ω to some n, we are <b>multiplying the angles of kth point of the "N-polygon" by our n</b>.
