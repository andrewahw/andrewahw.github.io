        <p>Now we know more about Fourier Transforms, let's look at an actual example you can use.</p>
        <p>The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) allows the transformation of an array of individual samples to another array of frequencies.
          To understand it, let's see the mathematical formulation of it:

            <p>To fully understand this formulation, we first must understand complex numbers</p>
            <!--Image of an argan diagram with a single point-->
            <p>Complex numbers can be imagined as a point on 2D space - with an "x" and "y" component.
              We express this in the form <i>a + bi</i>, where the "a" represents our x component, and the "b" our y component.
            </p>
            <p>Another way of expressing complex numbers is by it's relation to the origin, 0.
               Generally we do this in the form <i>a * e^bi</i>, where "a" is the distance from the origin and "b" is the angle between the point and the origin in radians.
            </p>
            <p>(Proving this is quite cool, but is also beyond the scope of this website!)</p>
